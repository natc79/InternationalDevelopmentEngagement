# Who cares?  Drivers of engagement in International Development

With over a quarter of the world's population on Facebook, the platform has become an effective tool for enhancing communication and outreach strategies.  For international development organizations, increased engagement can help to raise awareness and mobilize financial and in-kind support for key issues that contribute to social and economic development.  How do international development organizations differ in their approach to engagement in terms of frequency of posts, topic of posts, and associated media?  What are effective strategies for enhancing engagement on Facebook as measured by likes, comments, and shares of posts?  Do the timing of posts and frequency of posts matter?  Does using videos and photos provide attention getting value?  What topics of coverage generates greater comments? Are users sensitive to content subjectivity or degree of positive content contained in messages?

## Data

This project uses the Facebook page data of key organizations in international development and their feeds over time that is available from Facebook's public graph API.  It provides some preliminary insights into the production of social media by these organizations and strategies that could be effective in enhancing Facebook follower engagement.
